MAC OS X Dev Box Setup Script

This script is to automatically bootstrap a freshly installed MAC OS X Machine as a Developer Machine.

After a fresh Install of MAC OS X, download the setup_git.sh and run it to get git on the MAC if not already installed.

After that, clone this repository.

Run setup.sh as root.

At this point in time, the script will install:

1. XCode - Command line tools.
2. Homebrew - Mac Package Manager.
3. Latest Version of Git
